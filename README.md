# Alejandro's Library

## Overview
Alejandro's Library is a personal digital library and dashboard. It allows books to be added, edited, rated, visualized, and filtered. Built with **SQLite, Python, Streamlit, and Plotly**, the app feels like having your own public library on the web. 

When I was a young child, my mom would take me often to public libraries around town. She nurtured my love of reading at a young age. I will forever be grateful for that, so this is an ode to her. Thanks madre. 

The project began as a CS50 SQL final project and grew into a full interactive application. It serves both as a demonstration of relational database design and as a personal portfolio project.
